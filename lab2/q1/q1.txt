Question 1: Give the output of each of the following sets of statements.

(a) int a, b, c, d;
a = 5;
b = 10;
c = a * b;
a = 25;
d = a / b;
cout << c << " " << d << endl;

Output:
50 2

(b) int a, b, c, d;
a = 25;
b = 10;
a = a / b;
b = b / a;
cout << a << " " << b << endl;

Output:
2 5

(c) int a, b, c
a = 5;
b = a + 23;
cout << a << " " << b << endl;
a = a - 4;
c = 20 - a;
cout << a << " " << b << " " << c << endl;

Output:
5 28
